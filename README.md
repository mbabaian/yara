### [YARA](https://www.facebook.com/Young-Adult-Reader-Advisory-163238114307197/)

#### Current Version 1.0.0 
YARA is an open-source bot that makes book recommedations based on a patron's reading interests. While the focus of YARA is young adult readers in high school, it can be adapted to fit the needs of any community of readers.

Since this is a side project and I am not a professional developer, you may hit a few snags here and there. I welcome any comments or bug reports. Please contact me via the email listed in the Authors section at the bottom of this page or submit an Issue. 

In the meantime, I encourage you to adapt and use YARA to meet the needs of your library patrons.

You can chat with YARA by searching for Young Adult Reader Advisory on Facebook Messenger. **Please keep in mind that YARA is stored on a free site and may take a minute to respond. Say 'hi' or 'hello', wait fifteen seconds then try again.** 
Type 'help' for more specific instructions on how to use YARA. 
 

### Purpose
I created YARA as a unique way to promote the school library program and increase circulation statistics. 

## Features
- Uses [RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) - a simple, yet powerful open-source AI scripting language
- Built with [Botpress](https://botpress.io/) - open-source and easy-to-use bot framework
- Can be customized to serve any school library

### What YARA Does
- Conducts basic reference interview using natural language
- Provides book recommendations based on reading preferences
- Includes link to library card catalog 
- Engages in polite small talk 

### What YARA Doesn't Do
 - Conduct card catalog searches for patrons
 - Get the status of an item (CKO/CKI/Lost)
 - Rank books by popularity
 - Put up with any of your nonsense. And she means it, Mister.
 
### How YARA Works
The user can initiate the conversation with a simple hello or hi. After a few basic questions about reading interests, YARA gives the user a list of recommended books and provides a link to the school's card catalog.

### Fiction
At this time, YARA handles a limited number of fiction categories and themes:
- Fantasy
- Romance
- Dystopian
- Time Travel
- Humor
- Horror
- Vampires
- Zombies
- Realistic fiction
- Historical fiction
- Spies/Espionage
- Fae/Faeries
- Mystery

Future versions will include an expanded selection of genres and titles.

### Nonfiction

Currently, YARA does not have a nonfiction category. If the patron states a preference for nonfiction, YARA provides a direct link to the card catalog. If there is a demand for nonfiction, I will add it to future versions. But you are, of course, welcome to make any changes to YARA that you'd like.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è YARA should never be used to collect information about patrons or judge their reading interests or the manner in which they communicate with YARA. If this is your reason for implementing YARA in your school library, please reconsider. A good librarian knows better.

### Fun Stuff
Try one of the following phrases with YARA:
 
"My name is ________". 

"Who am I?"

"Who are you?" or "Who made you?"

"How are you?" or "hru?"

"I love you."

"I need a book." 

"I love books."

"Do you have any books with vampires?"

"Can you recommend some sci fi books?"

"Thank you."

"Goodbye."


Librarians are encouraged to customize YARA to match their specific collections and meet the needs of their students and teachers. 

## Built With
[Botpress](https://botpress.io/)

[RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/)

## Getting Help
I am happy to help any librarian with coding the logic for their YARA as well as deploying it. You can contact me via the information listed below. Both Botpress and RiveScript offer support to their products. I've had the most luck getting help on Botpress through its Slack channel. I haven't needed help with RiveScript yet, but I can see they do respond to Issues in GitHub.
